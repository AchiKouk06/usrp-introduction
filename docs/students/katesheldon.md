#Kate Sheldon
My name is Kate Sheldon. I'm a rising junior at Princeton majoring in physics. I am from Santa Barbara, CA. I am 19 years old.

This summer I will be analyzing data from the supermassive black holes Sagittarius A(star) and Messier 87. Using data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we will measure the polarization of light across different frequencies.
