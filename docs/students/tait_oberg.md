# Tait Oberg

```{note}
Hi, my name is Tait! 

I'm a rising junior in the Astro department. This summer I'm working on a project on Ganymede with Jamey Szalay at the Space Physics Lab.

In my free time, I love to play guitar and write music. Let me know if you wanna jam!

I'm from Boston orginally and have lived there my whole life.

Thanks for reading!
