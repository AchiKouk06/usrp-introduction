I'm a rising senior in the Astrophysical Sciences Department here at Princeton.

My research interests include black holes, galaxies, protoplanetary discs, and the ISM.

Outside of analyzing and understanding the universe computationally, I'm a big theatre kid, D&D player, and love making LEGO stop-motion animations. I can play the piano, guitar, flute, and sing.

Additionally I'm a pretty good home cook.
